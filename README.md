# PICO-8 Carts

## Introduction
This repo is a collection of carts (cartridges) that I have made for [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a virtual console for making and sharing video games. Each cart is its own "game" that can be loaded and played. Visit [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) to learn more, and have fun! 

My carts aren't full-fledged games, but they can be fun to mess around with. They provide simple examples of how to get started with movement, gravity, and collision detection. 

## Usage

To play the carts:
1. Purchase a copy of [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and install it.
2. Launch PICO-8.
3. Within PICO-8, use the "FOLDER" command to see where to put the carts.
4. Copy the carts (the *.p8 files) in this repo to PICO-8's carts folder.
5. Within PICO-8, load a cart like this: `load platformer.p8`.
6. Within PICO-8, run the cart using: `run`

## Keyboard Controls

My carts generally use the arrow keys for movement and the 'x' key for action.
